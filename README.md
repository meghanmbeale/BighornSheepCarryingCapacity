Equation for bighorn sheep carrying capacity
BHS CC = (sum of (F x U x A)) x SUF / FR

F = forage quality; measured in Mcal
U = relative winter selection by BHS; proportion between 0-1
A = area; based on winter range; proportion between 0-1
SUF = safe use factor; proportion between 0-1
FR = forage requirements for average BHS over entire winter; measured in Mcal
